# CollapseAll Component Usage

The CollapseAll component can collapse and expand all existing Facets at once while toggling the text displayed. 

You can set the initial state of your facets using the `isCollapsed` boolean property. If this is set to `true`, during CollapseAll's init() all facets will be collapsed. If it's set to `false`, all facets will be initially expanded.

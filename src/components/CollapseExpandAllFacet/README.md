# CollapseExpandAllFacet Component Usage

The CollapseExpandAllFacet component can collapse and expand all existing Facets at once while toggling the text displayed. 

You can set the initial state of your facets using the `data-is-collapsed` boolean property inside your markup file. If `data-is-collapsed` is set to `true` all facets will initially be collapsed. If it is set to `false`, all facets will initially be expanded.
